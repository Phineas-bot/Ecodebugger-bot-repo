## 1. XP System Improvements

- **XP Awarding Differentiation:**
  - Users now earn +10 XP for fixing bugs and +5 XP for applying eco tips, as specified in the feature requirements.
  - The `awardXP` function was introduced to handle XP logic for different actions.
- **XP Progress Bar:**
  - The Webview UI now displays a visual XP progress bar, showing progress toward the next level.
- **XP Log/History:**
  - An XP log records each XP-earning event (bug fix or eco tip) with a timestamp, and is viewable in the Webview under the 'Eco Tips Log' tab.

## 2. Eco Tips Engine

- **Trigger on Save:**
  - Eco tips are now automatically triggered when a supported file (Python, JavaScript, TypeScript) is saved, in addition to manual scan and real-time analysis.
- **Enable/Disable Eco Tips:**
  - A toggle in the Webview settings tab allows users to enable or disable eco tips.

## 3. Achievements & Badges

- **Achievements UI:**
  - The Webview displays badges in the 'Badges Earned' tab, visually distinguishing between unlocked and locked badges.

## 4. Webview UI Enhancements

- **Tabbed Interface:**
  - The Webview now features tabs for XP/Level, Badges, Eco Tips Log, Leaderboard, and Settings, improving navigation and user experience.
- **Settings Tab:**
  - Users can enable/disable eco tips and reset XP/achievements (reset functionality is stubbed for future implementation).
- **Leaderboard & Classroom Mode:**
  - The leaderboard is displayed in the 'Leaderboard' tab, and classroom mode is scaffolded for future expansion.
- **Mini Game:**
  - The Bug Fixer mini-game remains available and interactive in the UI.

## 5. Status Bar Button & Auto-Open Panel

  - The AI analyzes code in real-time to detect inefficiencies and provides actionable Eco Tips.
  - Suggestions include explanations, code snippets, and recommendations for improvement.

- **Achievements and XP Tracking:**
  - The AI tracks user progress, awarding XP for applying Eco Tips and fixing bugs.
  - Achievements are unlocked based on milestones, encouraging better coding practices.

- **Interactive Webview:**
  - The AI powers the EcoDebugger webview, enabling users to interact with Eco Tips, view achievements, and track XP.
  - Features like the "Replace Code" button allow users to apply suggestions directly.

- **Green Code Analysis:**
  - Tools like the `green_code_analyzer.py` script analyze code for environmental impact.
  - The AI integrates these insights into the extension for deeper analysis.

- **OpenAI Integration:**
  - The extension includes files (`openaiAssistantClient.ts`, `openaiAssistantSetup.ts`) suggesting integration with OpenAI for advanced capabilities.
  - Potential features include generating suggestions, answering questions, and providing contextual help.

## 8. VS Code API Usage

The EcoDebugger extension leverages the VS Code API extensively to provide its features. Below are the key areas where the API is utilized:

- **Webview Panels:**
  - The `vscode.WebviewPanel` API is used to create and manage the EcoDebugger UI.
  - Features like tabs, interactive elements, and dynamic content updates are powered by the Webview API.

- **Status Bar Items:**
  - The `vscode.StatusBarItem` API is used to add a button to the status bar for quick access to the EcoDebugger panel.
  - The status bar also displays the user's current XP and level.

- **Commands:**
  - The `vscode.commands.registerCommand` API is used to register commands like `ecoDebugger.openUI` and `Ecodebugger.helloWorld`.
  - These commands enable user interactions, such as opening the EcoDebugger panel or displaying welcome messages.

- **Event Listeners:**
  - The `vscode.workspace.onDidSaveTextDocument` API listens for file save events to trigger Eco Tips analysis.
  - The `vscode.window.onDidChangeActiveTextEditor` API is used for real-time code analysis.

- **Text Editor Integration:**
  - The `vscode.TextEditor` and `vscode.TextDocument` APIs are used to analyze and modify the user's code.
  - Features like detecting nested loops and applying code snippets rely on these APIs.

- **Extension Context:**
  - The `vscode.ExtensionContext` API is used to manage the extension's lifecycle and subscriptions.
  - It ensures that resources like status bar items and commands are properly disposed of when the extension is deactivated.

- **Messaging Between Webview and Extension:**
  - The `vscode.Webview.postMessage` and `vscode.Webview.onDidReceiveMessage` APIs enable communication between the Webview UI and the extension backend.
  - This is used for features like applying code snippets and updating the UI dynamically.

## 9. Utils Folder Overview

## 10. JavaScript Source Map Files (`.js.map`)

The `.js.map` files in the project are source map files generated during the TypeScript compilation process. These files serve the following purposes:

- **Debugging Support:**
  - Source maps allow developers to debug the original TypeScript code in tools like VS Code or browser developer tools, even though the code is executed as JavaScript.
  - They map the compiled JavaScript back to the original TypeScript source, making it easier to trace errors and understand the code flow.

- **Transparency:**
  - By including source maps, the project provides transparency into the original source code, which is especially useful for open-source projects.

- **Development Workflow:**
  - Source maps are essential for a smooth development workflow, enabling features like breakpoints and stack traces to reference the original TypeScript files.

- **Generated Files:**
  - These files are automatically generated by the TypeScript compiler based on the `tsconfig.json` configuration.
  - They are not meant to be edited manually and are typically excluded from production builds.
