## Overview

## 1. XP System Improvements
- **XP Awarding Differentiation:**
  - Users now earn +10 XP for fixing bugs and +5 XP for applying eco tips, as specified in the feature requirements.
  - The `awardXP` function was introduced to handle XP logic for different actions.
- **XP Progress Bar:**
  - The Webview UI now displays a visual XP progress bar, showing progress toward the next level.
- **XP Log/History:**
  - An XP log records each XP-earning event (bug fix or eco tip) with a timestamp, and is viewable in the Webview under the 'Eco Tips Log' tab.

## 2. Eco Tips Engine
- **Trigger on Save:**
  - Eco tips are now automatically triggered when a supported file (Python, JavaScript, TypeScript) is saved, in addition to manual scan and real-time analysis.
- **Enable/Disable Eco Tips:**
  - A toggle in the Webview settings tab allows users to enable or disable eco tips.

## 3. Achievements & Badges
- **More Badges:**
  - Additional badges (e.g., Efficient Thinker, Team Leader, XP Novice, Eco Streak) have been added, each with an icon, description, and locked/unlocked state.
- **Achievements UI:**
  - The Webview displays badges in the 'Badges Earned' tab, visually distinguishing between unlocked and locked badges.

## 4. Webview UI Enhancements
- **Tabbed Interface:**
  - The Webview now features tabs for XP/Level, Badges, Eco Tips Log, Leaderboard, and Settings, improving navigation and user experience.
- **Settings Tab:**
  - Users can enable/disable eco tips and reset XP/achievements (reset functionality is stubbed for future implementation).
- **Leaderboard & Classroom Mode:**
  - The leaderboard is displayed in the 'Leaderboard' tab, and classroom mode is scaffolded for future expansion.
- **Mini Game:**
  - The Bug Fixer mini-game remains available and interactive in the UI.

## 5. Status Bar Button & Auto-Open Panel
- **Quick Access Button:**
  - A button in the VS Code status bar allows users to open the EcoDebugger UI panel with a single click.
- **Auto-Open on Activation:**

## 6. Code Quality & Bug Fixes
