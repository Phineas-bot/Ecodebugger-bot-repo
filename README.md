# Eco-Debugger: A Gamified VS Code Extension


# INTRODUCTION

# General Introduction
As technology is on the rise, there’s also an increase in software development, which has a hidden environmental cost: inefficient code increases energy consumption across data centers and devices. Most developers focus more on functionality and performance of their system; eco-friendly coding practices are overlooked. Eco-debugger bridges this gap by integrating sustainability into the developer’s workflow through gamification and real-time guidance. This gamified VS Code extension educates programmers especially freshmen about energy-efficient coding patterns during debugging sessions, gamifies the debugging for fun experience. That is, it rewards you with XP for fixing bugs while suggesting energy-saving optimizations, making debugging more fun.

# Aims and Objectives
The aims and objectives of this gamified VS Code extension, Eco-Debugger will be elaborated in the following points.
# Aim:
The aim of Eco-Debugger is to make debugging fun while reducing carbon footprint of software by encouraging eco-friendly coding habits in VS code.
# Objectives:
The objectives of Eco-Debugger are short listed below.
 	Educate: To provide context-aware eco-tips during debugging sessions. For example; use map() instead of for loop when possible, avoid unnecessary print()/console.log() in production and use list/set comprehensions in Python for better efficiency.
 	Engage: To implement a gamified system where users earn badges/XP when fixing bugs detected by the extension or when eco-tips suggested by the extension are applied.
 	Analyze:  Develop real-time code analysis to highlight energy-wasteful patterns.
 	Track progress: Track developers’ eco-progress.

# Problem statement
Despite growing awareness of technology’s environmental impact, developers lack tools that make sustainable coding engaging and actionable. Current debugging extensions focus only on fixing errors, missing the opportunity to educate programmers about energy-efficient practices or incentivize greener solutions. Eco-Debugger bridges this gap by transforming debugging into a gamified experience.

We adopted the Agile Scrum methodology for iterative development ……..

# SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
Eco-Debugger’s system requirements prioritize both functionality (real-time code analysis, gamified feedback) and sustainability (low-overhead performance, scalability), ensuring the VS Code extension delivers an engaging, energy-conscious debugging experience without compromising developer productivity. Functional requirements include bug detection, XP rewards, and CO₂ emission estimates, while non-functional requirements enforce responsiveness, and minimal resource usage.
