i would like to build modern and gamified UI mockup,implement this UI in the vs code extension using a webview. and then create a simple game using the UI. The game should be interactive and engaging, with a focus on user experience. The UI should be visually appealing and easy to navigate, with clear instructions and feedback for the user. The game should be designed to be fun and challenging, with multiple levels or stages to keep the user engaged. The goal is to create a polished and professional-looking product that showcases the capabilities of the VS Code extension API and provides a unique gaming experience for users.
